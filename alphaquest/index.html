                      <h3> How AlphaQuest came to be </h3>
                      <p>I've always been into the RPG genre of video games. I decided that before I made a leap into
                        a big, graphical game, that I'd start small. Something like the old adventure games. AlphaQuest
                        does that, but with modern elements in it as well. When a school project came up, I though I
                        would start there.
                      </p>
                      <h3> Gameplay </h3>
											<p>The gameplay in AlphaQuest is quite simple. You kill monsters for money, and buy classes
                        to upgrade your character. Once you are strong enough, you can slay the evil dragon. Although
                        it's text-based, it still manages to have a slight charm. With the ascii characters and simple
                        gameplay, it makes for a fun experience.
                      </p>
                      <h3> Plans for the future </h3>
                      <p>
                        AlphaQuest was a learning experience. It was the biggest project I had ever made until Mult.
                        Someday, I may make a 'BetaQuest' Or something. But for now, I'm working on a bigger and better
                        Text-based RPG. It uses elements from AlphaQuest, but with a more stable story; level up system,
                        and just more to do.
                      </p>

														<h3><a href="#">Battle Engine</a></h3>
                            <p>This is a modified version of my first game, <em>Battle.</em> I took the battle from there, and
                              re organized it to make an engine. You type 1 to attack, and 2, to heal. If your agility is higher
                              than your enemy's, you attack first. If their agility is higher than yours, they attack first.
                            </p>

														<h3><a href="#">Save and Load</a></h3>
                            <p>The player can save and exit their game at the inn. The player saves their game and it logs to
                            a JSON file, and loads the same file. You can load your save file when the game starts.
                            </p>

														<h3><a href="#">The Shop</a></h3>
                            <p>The player can upgrade their character by buying an upgrade from the shop. There are 3 professions,
                            and 3 masteries. One type is based around speed, one is based around health, and one is based around healing.
                            This brings diversity to how you play.
